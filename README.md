# Personal Budget Tracker

A **Personal Budget Tracker** written in **Go (Golang)** that allows users to manage their finances by adding, viewing, and categorizing transactions. The app also calculates total income and expenses, and saves transaction data to a CSV file.

## Features

- **Add Transactions**: Record income or expenses with categories.
- **View Transactions**: Display a list of all recorded transactions with details such as amount, category, date, and type.
- **Calculate Totals**: Calculate the total income or expenses separately.
- **Export Data**: Save all transactions to a CSV file for further analysis or record-keeping.
- **Interactive Menu**: User-friendly console-based menu for easy navigation.

## How It Works

1. **Add Transactions**: 
   - Enter the amount, category, and type (`income` or `expense`).
   - Each transaction is assigned a unique ID and the current date.

2. **View Transactions**:
   - Displays all transactions in a tabular format.

3. **Calculate Totals**:
   - Get the total income or expenses based on the transaction type.

4. **Save to CSV**:
   - Export transactions to a `.csv` file for use with external tools like Excel.

5. **Exit**:
   - Close the application gracefully.

## Code Overview

### 1. **`Transaction` Struct**
Represents a financial transaction with:
- `ID`: Unique identifier.
- `Amount`: The transaction value.
- `Category`: The category of the transaction (e.g., "Food", "Rent").
- `Date`: The date the transaction was recorded.
- `Type`: Either `income` or `expense`.

### 2. **`BudgetTracker` Struct**
Manages a list of transactions and provides functionalities to:
- Add transactions.
- Display transactions.
- Calculate totals for income or expenses.
- Save transactions to a CSV file.

### 3. **Interface Implementation**
Implements the `FinancialRecord` interface for transactions, providing:
- `GetAmount()`: Returns the amount of the transaction.
- `GetType()`: Returns the type (`income` or `expense`).

### 4. **CSV Export**
Uses the `encoding/csv` package to save transaction data to a `.csv` file in a structured format.

### 5. **Interactive Menu**
Provides a console-based menu with the following options:
1. Add a new transaction.
2. View all transactions.
3. Show total income.
4. Show total expenses.
5. Save transactions to a CSV file.
6. Exit the application.
